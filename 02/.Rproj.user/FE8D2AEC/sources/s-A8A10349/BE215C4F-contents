#### Introduction
The aim of this assignment is to get familiar with multivariate confirmation analysis.
As such, the objective of confirmation analysis is to test hypotheses or theories model. These models could be based on a previous empirical research.
For this purpose, you will use multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
to test your hypothesis about given data.

The deadline for this assignment is 4.11.2019.

### Input data
In this tutorial, we will work with a dataset that aims to the quality of potatoes growing in Oregon (for more details see [1]). Each potato is determined
by its size, area, holding temperature, holding period, and cooking method.
Overall quality consists of three aspects: texture score, flavor score, and
moistness score. In this context, the properties of potatoes could be seen as
independent variables; on the other hand, the quality of potatoes are dependent variables. For loading of the dataset, you can use a prepared function
`Load`:

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#load the dataset
Load <- function(path = "potato.dat"){
  potatoData <- read.table(path, header = FALSE)
  colnames(potatoData) <- c("Area", "Size" ,"Temp", "Period", "Method", "Texture", "Flavor", "Moistness")
  potatoData$Area <- as.factor(potatoData$Area)
  potatoData$Size <- as.factor(potatoData$Size)
  potatoData$Temp <- as.factor(potatoData$Temp)
  potatoData$Period <- as.factor(potatoData$Period)
  potatoData$Method <- as.factor(potatoData$Method)
  return(potatoData)
}

source("boxTest.R")
library(mvnormtest)
library(MVN)
library(gplots)

#load the dataset
potatoData <- Load()
```

### MANOVA
There are four main theoretical issues to be considered before running MANOVA.
Not surprisingly, MANOVA has similar assumptions to ANOVA but extended to the multivariable case:

* **Independence**: Observations should be statistically independent.
* **Random sampling**: Data are randomly sampled from the population
of interest.
* **Multivariate normality**: Dependent variables are multivariate normally distributed within each group of the independent variables, which
are categorical.
* **Homogeneity of covariance matrices**: The population covariance
matrices of each group are equal.

Take the initial assumptions granted. The assumption of multivariate normality can be tested using R with a test known as the Shapiro test implemented in mshapiro.test in `mvnormtest` package. The assumption of
equality of covariance matrices is often tested using Box’s test that is implemented in `BoxMTest` function in `boxTest.R` file or as a `BoxM` function in biotools package.

### Step by Step
You should go through the following steps:

1. Formalize your MANOVA hypothesis.
2. Visualize your data using plot, boxplot, etc. If data have more than two
dimensions project them to lower dimmensionionality. (Optional: use a dimensionality reduction method instead.)
3. Check the assumptions for MANOVA model.
4. Use MANOVA to test your hypothesis.
5. Discuss the obtained results (the meaning of the individual statistics,
comparison with the visual analysis ad 2, practical implications), compare with the results of simpler MANOVA alternatives (e.g. repeated
ANOVA).

# Solution

## 1.
Manova hypothesis is following - Does cathegorical independent variable temperature influence flavour and texture?
Or in other words, are means in the groups statistically different, or not?

## 2.
Let's try to visualize the data via box plots.
```{r}
boxplot(potatoData$Texture~potatoData$Temp, col="green", ylab="value", xlab="Temperature")
boxplot(potatoData$Flavor~potatoData$Temp,add=TRUE, col="red")
legend("topleft",legend=c("Texture", "Flavor"),col=c("green","red"),pch=19)
```
We can see, that that the IRQs are partially covering themselfs. 
Also, there are exactly 3 outliers that are present in the Flavor data.
```{r}
boxplot(potatoData$Flavor~potatoData$Temp, col="red", ylab="Flavor", xlab="Temperature")
```
These outliners indicates a possible violation of multivariate normality
Therefore we must verify whether multivariate normality is present or not.

##3.
Multivariate normality can be tested via Shapiro-Wilk normality test.
```{r}
mshapiro.test(t(cbind(potatoData$Flavor[potatoData$Temp==1], potatoData$Texture[potatoData$Temp==1])))
```
```{r}
mshapiro.test(t(cbind(potatoData$Flavor[potatoData$Temp==2], potatoData$Texture[potatoData$Temp==2])))
```
Since the p-value of the tests in both groups is greater than 0.05, we can not reject the null hypothesis
and therefore we can assume that the data are multivariate normal.

Now we must test the homogenity of convariance matrices via BoxMTest.
```{r}
BoxMTest(cbind(potatoData$Texture, potatoData$Flavor), potatoData$Temp)
```
As well as in the previous test, we can not recet the null hypothesis, that the convariance matrices are not significantly different.
Therefore all predispositions of Manova are met and we can continue.

## 4.
Let's use manova to test the null hypothesis we defined in the task 1.
```{r}
summary(manova(cbind(potatoData$Texture, potatoData$Flavor)~potatoData$Temp))
```

The p-value is lower then the 0.05 and therefore we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative one,
that basically states, that the temperature value have effect on the texture and flavor.

## 5.
We can try to verify same null hypothesis with two anova runs. 
```{r}
summary(aov(potatoData$Texture~potatoData$Temp))
summary(aov(potatoData$Flavor~potatoData$Temp))
```
Now, we must adjust the p-value using Bonferroni correction, because we ran multiple tests.
Therefore the real p-value of the first anova run will be:
```
6.57e-05 * 2 = 0.0001314
```
and second run:
```
0.956 * 2 >= 1 -> p-value = 1
```
Now we can compare both value with `0.05` and we found out, that the repeated anova would reject the null hypothesis as well as manova, because the first run returned `0.0001314`.
