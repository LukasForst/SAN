     PLEASE NOTE:  The components ""delsgs"" and ""summary"" of the
 object returned by deldir() are now DATA FRAMES rather than
 matrices (as they were prior to release 0.0-18).
 See help(""deldir"").
 
     PLEASE NOTE: The process that deldir() uses for determining
 duplicated points has changed from that used in version
 0.0-9 of this package (and previously). See help(""deldir"").
